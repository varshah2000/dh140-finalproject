# Final Project Proposal: Inside the Scooby-Doo Verse

This project aims to explore the Scooby-Doo universe and answer some controversial questions about the Gang and their adventures capturing monsters and villains.  

## Research Question:

### Who is the strongest link and  the weakest link among the Gang? 

The Scooby-Doo Gang consists of five total members: Fred, Velma, Daphne, Shaggy, and Scooby-Doo. Fans of Scooby-Doo have their favorites for numerous reasons, however many may argue who is the strongest link and who is the weakest link among the gang. Is Velma the strongest because she is the smartest? Or is she the weakest because of her bad eyesight? Or is Fred the strongest due to his leadership qualities? Or is he the weakest because he brings nothing else to the table? This project may bring about controversy because the answer may not be what we expect due to personal opinions. However, we aim to answer this question using different metrics such as: the number of times each character has been captured by a villain, the number of snacks they consume in an episode, the number of villains they've captured themselves, etc. Hopefully after our extensive analysis, we're able to come to a decisive conclusion.  

## The Data 

The dataset was originally created by plummye and shared on Kaggle. However, I found the dataset in the form of a csv on Data.World. The dataset includes several variables about the characters, villains, ratings, and more for every episode and movie to exist in the Scooby-Doo universe.

## Project Scope

The goal of our project is to answer our research question through several visualizations and statistical analysis. One way we can answer this question is to calculate the frequency of villains each gang member was able to capture throughout time and the frequency of abductions for each gang member. We can visualize these results through a pie chart or bar chart for visual context. As we look further into our data, we hope to create 3-5 visualizations that aid in our answering our research question.     

Here are some other questions we can ask & look into as we explore our data: 
- Do Scooby Snacks improve the capabilities of each Gang member? In other words, does Scooby Snack consumption boost one's ability to capture villains? 
- Which Gang member captures the most monsters? Which Gang member captures the least? 
- What is the frequency of real and fake monsters within the Scooby Doo verse? Are most monsters fake or real?
- What is the mode number of snacks consumed in the series? 
- Who has consumed the most Scooby snacks over the course of the series? Who has consumed the least?

## Conclusion

With this project we hope to come closer to identifying who is the strongest and weakest links among the Gang members of Scooby-Doo. Is it Fred? Velma? Shaggy? Daphne? Or even more surprisingly, Scooby? Additionally, we hope to see how Scooby Snacks may impact the performance of the Gang and identify the most formidable villains within the Scooby-Doo verse. Hopefully through our analysis, we are able to come closer to an answer based on the data and statistics!
